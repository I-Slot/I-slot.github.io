        Hi there! I'm passionate front-end developer with expertise in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React.

        With over 1 year of experience in the industry, I have successfully worked on numerous projects, creating
        engaging and intuitive user interfaces. My solid foundation in web development allows me to bring designs to
        life while ensuring optimal performance and cross-browser compatibility.<br>

        Proficient in HTML5 and CSS3, I strive to write clean, semantic code that adheres to industry best practices. I
        have a keen eye for detail and a deep understanding of responsive design principles, enabling me to create
        seamless experiences across devices and screen sizes. <br>

        JavaScript is my playground, and I love leveraging its power to build interactive and dynamic web applications.
        I'm well-versed in modern frameworks and libraries, with a particular focus on React. I enjoy harnessing the
        benefits of React's component-based architecture to develop scalable and reusable UI components, improving
        development efficiency and maintainability. <br>

        I'm constantly expanding my skill set and staying up to date with the latest trends and technologies in
        front-end development. I have experience with responsive design, Bootstrap, React, and Git. <br>

        Collaboration and teamwork are integral to my work ethos. I thrive in dynamic environments where I can
        contribute my technical skills and collaborate with designers, backend developers, and stakeholders to deliver
        exceptional user experiences. <br>

        applications using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React, let's connect! I'm open to exciting opportunities where I
        can contribute my skills and be part of a driven team. <br>
