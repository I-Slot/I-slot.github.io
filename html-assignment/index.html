            Hi there! I'm passionate front-end developer with expertise in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React.
    
            With over 1 year of experience in the industry, I have successfully worked on numerous projects, creating
            engaging and intuitive user interfaces. My solid foundation in web development allows me to bring designs to
            life while ensuring optimal performance and cross-browser compatibility.<br>
    
            Proficient in HTML5 and CSS3, I strive to write clean, semantic code that adheres to industry best practices. I
            have a keen eye for detail and a deep understanding of responsive design principles, enabling me to create
            seamless experiences across devices and screen sizes. <br>
